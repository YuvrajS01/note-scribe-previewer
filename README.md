## AI-Powered Note Generation

- **How it works:**
  - Toggle the "Make with AI" switch in the input panel.
  - Enter one or more questions/topics (one per line).
  - Click "Generate & Add to Document". The app will use Google Gemini to generate a detailed answer for each question and add it as a content block.
  - Answers are formatted as a single paragraph (10‚Äì15 lines) per question, with multi-paragraph answers separated by `--` (double dash).
  - The AI never returns extra text or preamble‚Äîjust the answers, mapped to your questions.

- **Privacy & Security:**
  - Your Gemini API key is never exposed to the browser. All AI requests are securely proxied through a backend (local dev) or a Vercel serverless function (production).
  - To use the AI feature in production, set your `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in your Vercel project settings.

---

## Usage Guide

- **Add Content**: Use the input panel to add new content blocks (topic, notes, images).
- **AI Answers**: Toggle "Make with AI" to generate answers for a list of questions/topics using Gemini AI.
- **Edit & Organize**: See your content blocks appear in the live preview. Delete blocks or adjust font size and column gaps as needed.
- **Live Preview**: The center panel shows your notes in a two-column, A4-paper style layout. All formatting updates in real time.
- **Export PDF**: Click the 'Download Final PDF' button to export your notes. The PDF will look exactly like the live preview.

---

## PDF Export

- The PDF export uses `html2canvas` and `jsPDF` to capture the A4 preview and generate a high-fidelity PDF.
- All formatting, font sizes, images, and column gaps are preserved in the exported file.
- The export is instant and works entirely in the browser‚Äîno server required.

---

## Customization

- **Font Size**: Use the dropdown in the Document Content panel to change the font size for all notes.
- **Column Gaps**: (If enabled) Use the sliders to adjust vertical spacing between blocks in each column.
- **Styling**: Modify Tailwind CSS classes or shadcn-ui components for further UI customization.

---

## Deployment

- For AI features, you must set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your Vercel project settings (or in a `.env` file for local development).
- The Gemini API is accessed securely via a Vercel serverless function at `/api/gemini`‚Äîyour API key is never exposed to the client.
